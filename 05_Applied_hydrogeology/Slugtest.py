            Slug tests are quick and cost-effective field methods used to determine the hydraulic conductivity (K) of an aquifer. They involve a sudden change in water level within a well (either by adding or removing a known volume of water, or inserting/removing a slug) and measuring the subsequent water level recovery over time, see subsequent figure.

                        These tests are ideal for:
            - Assessing aquifer properties in low-permeability formations.
            - Situations where pumping tests are not feasible due to time or space constraints.
            - Monitoring wells where minimal disturbance to the aquifer is desired.
            
            Types of Slug Tests:
            - Rising-head test: Water level rises after removal of a slug.
            - Falling-head test: Water level falls after adding water or a slug.
            
            **Why use slug tests?** They are fast, inexpensive, and suitable for small-scale investigations, making them a standard tool in hydrogeological site assessments.
            
            The **Bouwer and Rice (1976) method** is a widely used approach to evaluate **slug test data**, especially in **partially penetrating wells** in **unconfined aquifers**. It relates the **water level recovery** to the **hydraulic conductivity** of the aquifer, accounting for well geometry and screen penetration.
