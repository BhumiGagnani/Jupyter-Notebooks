    "# Theis pumping test - Fitting Theis to measured data\n",
    "This notebook demonstrate the application of the Theis principle for pumping test evaluation in confined, transient setups. The notebook is based on an Spreadsheet from Prof. Rudolf Liedl.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### General situation\n",
    "We consider a confined aquifer with constant transmissivity. If a well is pumping water out of the aquifer, radial flow towards the well is induced. The following figure illustrates this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"FIGS/Flow_well_confined.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fig: Radial flow in a confined aquifer (Fetter, 1994)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculate the hydraulic situation, the following simplified flow equation can be used. This equation accounts for 1D radial transient flow towards a fully penetrating well within a confined aquifer without further sinks and sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial r^2}+\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial r}=\\frac{S}{T}\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution by Theis for confined aquifers\n",
    "Charles V. Theis presented a solution for this by deriving\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s(r,t)=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi T}W(u) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the well function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W(u) = \\int_{u }^{+\\infty} \\frac{e^{-\\tilde u}}{\\tilde u}d\\tilde u $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the dimensionless variable \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u = \\frac{Sr^2}{4Tt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equations are not easy to solve. Historically, values for the well function were provided by tables or as so called type-curve. The type-curve matching with experimental data for pumping test analysis can be considered as one of the basic hydrogeological methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, modern computer provide an easier and more convinient way to solve the 1D radial flow equation based on the Theis approach. Subsequently, the Theis equation is solved with Python routines. The results for the measured data are graphically presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Curve fitting with s-t plots\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, time and drawdown are provided by the Theis solution with \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s =\\frac{Q}{4\\pi T}W(u) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{Sr^2}{4T} \\frac{1}{u} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, time and drawdown are plotted and fitted to measured time and drawdown data.\n",
