    To navigate the Pumping test analysis tool you can use menu items at the sidebar:
    - Learn about the underlying theory
    - Investigate how a confined aquifer reacts on pumping
    - Understand the behavior and characteristics of the Theis solution for confined aquifers
    - Understand the behavior and characteristics of the Neuman solution for unconfined aquifers
    - Estimate the parameters for a confined aquifer and understand the effect of parameter uncertainty for future drawdown prediction
    - Finally, investigate real measured data (or your own dataset) with the Theis or Neuman solution.
