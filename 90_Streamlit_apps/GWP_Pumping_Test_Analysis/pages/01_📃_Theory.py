            ### Introduction and Overview
            This part of the app provides a general overview about groundwater flow towards well. The basic principles for a quantitative description of the processes with mathematical equations are explained and derived. The individual details for specific solutions (like Theis, Hantush/Jacob, Neuman) are provided in the specific parts of the app.
            
            At the beginning, we provide an initial assessment with a few questions to allow you to understand your current state of knowledge.

            ### General situation
            We consider a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer. The aquifer can be confined, leady, or unconfined. If a well is pumping water out of the aquifer, radial flow towards the well is induced. To calculate the hydraulic situation, the following simplified flow equation can be used. This equation accounts for 1D radial transient flow towards a fully penetrating well within a confined or unconfined aquifer without further sinks and sources:

            This equations are not easy to solve. Historically, values for the well function were provided by tables or as so called type-curve. The type-curve matching with experimental data for pumping test analysis can be considered as one of the basic hydrogeological methods. However, modern computer provide an easier and more convinient way to solve the 1D radial flow equation based on the Theis approach. Subsequently, the Theis equation is solved with Python routines.
