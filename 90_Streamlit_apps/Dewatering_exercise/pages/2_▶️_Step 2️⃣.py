    ### Dewatering exercise üí¶
    ---
    ## Step 2
    
    Consider a well pumping at a rate of Q = 300 m3/d
    The aquifer has the properties: T = 3.02 e-04 m2/s, S = 3.02 e-03
    The far edge of the zone to be dewatered is at a distance r = 100 from the well.
    
    #### Use the following tool to answer these questions.
    
    - The mine requires a minimum drawdown of 5 m, how long will this take to achieve‚ùì
    - The mine requires a maximum drawdown of 7 m, when is this drawdown reached‚ùì
    
    #### Then answer these questions.
    
    - How would dewatering impact a town well that is 2500 m from the dewatering well‚ùì
    - Should the town object to the dewatering‚ùì
    
    - How might dewatering impact a stream that is 7500 m from the dewatering well‚ùì
    - Should an environmental group object to the dewatering‚ùì
    
    #### Finally, use your results and the tool to address these questions.üöÄ
    
    - How are the drawdown curves at 100, 2500, and 7500 similar and how are they different?
    - Explore different dewatering pumping rates to see their impacts on the three stakeholders.
    - Use the drawdown comparison chart that shows two curves to explore how different S and T values affect the drawdown.
