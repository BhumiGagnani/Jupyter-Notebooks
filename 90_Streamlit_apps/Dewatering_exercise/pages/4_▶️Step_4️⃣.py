    ### Dewatering exercise ðŸ’¦
    ---
    ## Step 4
    * Discuss how stakeholders can use utility to find a compromise decision for the dewatering rate.
    * Consider that the values of _T_, _S_, and the distances to the stakeholder interests are known and correct.
    * Use any tools that have been shown to you previously to explore the utilities of different pumping rates for all stakeholders.    
    * You should agree upon the utility curves for each stakeholder before you begin your analyses.    
    * You should work as a class, with each person exploring two different Q values that you decide upon collectively.
    * Produce a common table with Q and utility for each stakeholder.
    * Once you have your table complete, discuss how you can use it to choose the best Q from those that you examined.
    * Who was Pareto?  Check out Vilfredo Pareto on Wikipedia!
    * What is the Pareto Principle?  Think of some examples of its application!
    * Introduce Pareto optimization generally and discuss how it could be applied to this problem for the mine and the town.

    
    
    #### Assignment after step 4. ðŸ“‘
    ðŸ‘‰ Plot the utility for the mine against the utility for the town using a point for each dewatering rate considered in class.
    
    ðŸ‘‰ Explain the meaning of the Pareto Front.
    
    ðŸ‘‰ Choose one pumping rate that is not on the front and explain in a clear paragraph why it is not among the optimal pumping rates.
