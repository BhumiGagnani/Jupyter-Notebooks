    ### Dewatering exercise ðŸ’¦
    ---
    ## Step 01
    
    - Lead a discussion about how dewatering might affect nearby stakeholders.  Good examples include the water supply for a nearby town and a stream that is important to an environmental group.
    
    - Introduce Henry Darcy and show a simplified version of his experiment.  Have students reason their way to Darcys Law.
    
    - Turn the column on its side, explore why the gradient will be constant along the column.
    
    - Convert the column to a constant rectangular cross section.  Then reason through why the gradient would not change along the column.
    
    - Introduce transient flow.  First, show two constant gradient condtions, same inflow H, two different outflow H values.
    
    - Reason through how the gradient would change in time from higher to lower inflow H with step change at boundary.
    
    - Convert the column to a decreasing cross sectional area towards outflow.  Then reason through why the gradient would change along the column under steady state flow .
    
    - Show two steady state conditions for column with a decreasing cross sectional area towards outflow with same inflow H, two different outflow H values.
    
    - Reason through how the gradient would change in time from higher to lower inflow H with step change at boundary.
    
    - Show a cross section of a well in an aquifer - you decide if you want to show that it is confined for the sake of accuracy versus simplicity.
    
    - Draw analogy of radial flow towards a well and decreasing area 1D case shown previously.
    
    - Talk through the transient response of an aquifer to pumping.
    
    - Relate this to distant effects of pumping through time.
    
    - Show a supply well and discuss why a decreased water level could be detrimental.
    
    - Show a groundwater-connected stream and discuss why a decreased water level could be detrimental.
