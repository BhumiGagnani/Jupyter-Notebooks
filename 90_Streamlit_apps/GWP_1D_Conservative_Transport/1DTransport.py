    This app is designed to introduce the computation of solute transport in a steady 1D flow domain. 
     
    In an aquifer, a possible contamination will be transported along the regional groundwatre flow direction by processes like advection and hydrodynamic dispersion. The 1D Conservative Transport interactive tool calculates the break through curve for a block input in a 1D steady flow field (i.e., representing flow in a homogeneous, isotropic aquifer). The following properties can be entered by the user.
    - effective porosity _n_ (dimensionless)
    - dispersivity _alpha_ (meters)
    
    Additional inputs allow the user to modify the shown plot and to add measured data.
