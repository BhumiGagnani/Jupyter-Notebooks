            ### About the computed situation
            
            Transport is considered for a 1D system with steady groundwater flow with a specific discharge _q_ of 0.016 m/s. The average velocity is depending on the porosity and printed below the interactive plot.
            
            The solutes are added by an Dirac pulse with a user defined mass.
            
            The plot shows the solute concentration for advective-dispersive transport. The break through curve is computed for an observation point in a user-defined distance from the source. It is possible to plot a second breakthrough curve in an user-defined distance relative to the first observation.
