   The solute plumes differ due to the nature of the source.
    - The :blue[Continuous Source is water of specified concentration continuously introduced to the inflow end of the column such that mass is continuously added to the system.] On average, the solutes move at the average velocity of the water molecules, but some move faster and some slower because of variable water velocity in the pores, so the front of the plume exhibits concentrations lower than the source concentration tapering down to zero. Eventually the water concentration over the entire length of the column will be the same as the source concentration.
    - The :blue[Volume Pulse Source is a specified volume containing an evenly distributed specified mass introduced to the inflow end of the column.] The concentration is determined as a specified mass divided by the volume. The solutes flow in for the period of time required to take in that volume given the flow rate in the column. The solutes move with the groundwater flow and spread longitudinally with ever decreasing concentration.
