    This application is designed for educational purposes to introduce the computation of solute transport in a steady one-dimensional groundwater flow domain. 
     
    In an aquifer, a conservative solute may be transported along the regional groundwater flow direction by the processes of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion. 
    
    A conservative solute does not undergo chemical reactions nor does it attach to the medium so it moves at the same velocity as the groundwater. 
    
    :blue[The 1D Conservative Transport Application calculates the break through curve for two types of input sources with ONLY longitudinal dispersion in one-dimensional steady flow through a homogeneous porous medium.] This is representative of solute moving through a laboratory column full of homogeneous sand.
