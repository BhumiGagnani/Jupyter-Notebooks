            ### Intermediate conclusion and next steps
            So far, we investigated the flow to a well in a confined aquifer. We saw how the Theis solution can be used to calculate the drawdown in response to pumping for a specific place and time.
            
            In the next part of the application, we will see how we can derive the parameters of the aquifer with measured data. Move to the next section by using the sidemenu or the subsequent buttons.
