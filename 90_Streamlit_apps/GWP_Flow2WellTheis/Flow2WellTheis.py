    To navigate the Flow2Well tool you can use menu items at the sidebar:
    - Learn about the underlying theory
    - Investigate how a confined aquifer reacts on pumping
    - Estimate the parameters of an aquifer by parameter fitting
    - Estimate the parameters of real aquifers by example data sets
    - Finally, compare the reaction of confined and unconfined aquifers on pumping.
