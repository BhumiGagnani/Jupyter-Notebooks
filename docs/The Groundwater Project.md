# The Groundwater Project

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks for the Groundwater Project.

**Jupyter Notebooks as interactive educational resources for the Groundwater Project**

The following is an overview of (initial) notebooks that are suitable for the Groundwater Project. The Jupyter Notebooks are part of the general collection of Jupyter Notebooks in the iNUX GitHub Repository. You can access and execute them through the MyBinder service with the provided link or by using the QR code on your mobile device. By using these links, all Notebooks will be rendered as (user-friendly) Voila-Dashboards, i.e., the underlying Python Code is not visible.
