# Flow to wells 

## Well capture zone
This [**app**](https://well-capture-zone.streamlit.app/) computes the capture zone for an abstraction well in a confined aquifer. The user can modify parameters like pumping rate _Q_, hydraulic conductivity _K_, and more to investigate the effect on the shape of the capture zone.

## Steady state flow to a well in a confined aquifer (Thiem solution)
This [**app**](https://flow2well-thiem-confined.streamlit.app/) computes the steady state flow to a well in a confined aquifer by using the Thiem equation. The user can modify parameters like pumping rate _Q_, hydraulic conductivity _K_, and more to investigate the effect on the cone of drawdown.

## Steady state flow to a well in an unconfined aquifer (Thiem solution)
This [**app**](https://flow2well-thiem-unconfined.streamlit.app/) computes the steady state flow to a well in an unconfined aquifer by using the Thiem equation. The user can modify parameters like pumping rate _Q_, hydraulic conductivity _K_, and more to investigate the effect on the cone of drawdown.

## Transient flow to a well in a confined aquifer (Theis solution)
This [**app**](https://flow2well-transient-confined.streamlit.app/) computes the transient flow to a well in an confined aquifer by using the Theis solution. The user can modify parameters like pumping rate _Q_, transmissivity _T_, and more to investigate the effect on the cone of drawdown. Results can be visualized as function of time and space.

## Transient flow to a well in a confined aquifer (Theis solution)
This [**app**](https://flow2well-transient-unconfined-confined.streamlit.app/) computes the transient flow to a well in an confined and unconfined aquifer by using the Theis solution. The user can modify parameters like pumping rate _Q_, transmissivity _T_, Storativity and more to investigate the effect on the cone of drawdown for both aquifer types. Results can be visualized as function of time and space.
